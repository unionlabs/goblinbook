# Project: Nexus

In this project, we will implement the basics of a multichain decentralized exchange (dex). We will allow users to swap assets by trading against solvers. Our exchange is thus an intent-based protocol.

## Functionality

Our application will have the following functionality:

- Swaps: choose assets.
- Bridge: choose the destination chain.
- History: track historic trades

We will focus on implementing the logic only. Frontend, design and UX will not be covered (although we'd gladly accept PRs to expand the guide).
